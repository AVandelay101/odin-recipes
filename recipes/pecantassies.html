        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Pecan Tassies only have 6 ingredients! They are made of a buttery pie crust and filled with brown sugar and pecan filling. Theyâ€™re the perfect bite-sized treat!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup unsalted cold butter equal to 2 sticks</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups pecans chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the chopped pecans, brown sugar, and eggs. Then set them aside.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl cut the cold butter into the flour until the butter becomes pea-sized. I like to use a pastry cutter for this but you can do it in a food processor as well.</li>
                <li>Then combine the cream cheese with the butter and flour. At this point, I just used my hands because the dough begins to form into one piece.</li>
                <li>Scoop out 1 tablespoon-sized piece of the dough and form them into balls. Then place them into a greased mini muffin tin.</li>
                <li>Using your fingers flatten out each ball so it takes up the shape of the hollow tin. Then fill each pocket with 1 tablespoon of the pecan filling.</li>
                <li>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20-25 minutes. After the pecan pies cool, you can leave them as they are or drizzle a little bit of melted semisweet chocolate on top. Tip: These can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
            </ol>
